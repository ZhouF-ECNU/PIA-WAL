# PIA-WAL: Peripheral Instance Augmentation for End-to-End Anomaly Detection using Weighted Adversarial Learning
In this work, we develop a weighted generative model by leveraging a few labelled anomalies for anomaly detection, named PIA-WAL. The goal of our model is to learn representative descriptions of normal instances in order to reduce  the amount of false positives while maintaining accurate anomaly detection.
